# put your "I would have done this with more time"-style comments here

I have completed all 5 tasks to a level that I feel fulfill what was asked for in the readme. However, if I had more time, I would have done the following things:

- Updated CSS for better appearance
- Spent more time on validation / error handling. I did include some, but it would have perhaps been better to separate this into a utils / error handling file
- Include some unit tests

I know the above weren't necessarily requirements asked for in the readme, but this is more just how I would have went beyond it if I had more time and doing extra was encouraged.

Thanks :)
David
